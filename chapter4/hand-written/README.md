Hand-Written LL(1) Parser and Scanner
-------------------------------------

This shows a simple example of a hand-written scanner
and a hand-written recursive-descent parser for an LL(1)
expression language.  The program attempts to parse the
input and determine whether the parse succeeds, but
does not evaluate the expression.

Some suggested exercises:
- Modify the program to compute the value of the expression, if it parses.

- Modify the scanner and parser to handle more complex expressions,
such as floating point values and additional operators.
