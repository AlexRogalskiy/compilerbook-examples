Example Code for Introduction to Compilers and Language Design
--------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains some example code and test cases
for the [Introduction to Compilers and Language Design](http://compilerbook.org)
online textbook.

- chapter3/flex contains a complete example of the flex
program from chapter 3.

- chapter4/hand-written contains a complete hand-written
scanner and parser using the recursive descent technique
for LL(1) grammars shown in chapter 4.

- chapter5 contains several variations on the running
calculator example, showing an *incorrect* example with
multiple shift-reduce conflicts, a working validator,
inline evaluator, and interpreter.

- starter-code contains the starter code for the B-Minor project.
This incorporates the header files defined in the text book,
and gives a simple structure that will help to avoid some
common software engineering pitfalls.

- tests contains some sample test cases that demonstrate how
to automate testing for each stage of the project.  Note that
the test cases are not necessarily comprehensive: both students
and instructors are advised to carefully study the language,
write new test cases, and discuss any areas of ambiguity.
